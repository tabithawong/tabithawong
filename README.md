### Hi, I'm Tabitha (she/her)! 

### I'm a software developer who is passionate about learning ✍️ 

I'm always looking for solutions to problems that I see around me. I'm interested in web development, product/project management, and full-stack development. I'm a double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, studying Computer Science and Business Administration.

Some other fun facts about me are that I'm left-handed, a HUGE fan of Taylor Swift, and I love giraffes 🦒 
#I was born in Hong Kong 🇭🇰 and I'm fully fluent in Cantonese!

I love to attend hackathons to meet new people and get inspiration for new projects ideas.
